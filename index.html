    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> 
        Use HTTPS/SSL, HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and can be said as the combination of HTTP and SSL. 
        SSL keeps internet connections secure and prevents criminals from reading or modifying information transferred between two systems. 
        <br />
        Use secure authentication methods, strengthen password and use two-factor authentication.
        <br />
        Be aware of third-party security risks, use well tested third party applications and plugins.  
        <br />
        Make sure to also secure personal/employee's computers use secure connections, like using SFTP over FTP. 
        <br />
        Make sure to validate all user input. This is to avoid SQL injections which is one of the most used hacker methods to access sensitive information in the database. 
        <br />
        Keep up with the updates. If you have updates in your websites/server that is long overdue this can create major security issues to your site. 
        So, make sure you stay on top of important updates.   
        <br />
        Test your website both with web security tools and with people. Try to run your site through web security tools to check for holes in your security. 
        But get people to run some mock tests on your site too.  
        <br />
        Be aware of file uploads, if you have the need for the users to upload files make sure you add filter to secure it from uploading malicious files/codes.   
        <br />
        Monitor your site and make frequent backups. No matter how secure your site is always be prepared for the worst so having frequent 
        backups of your site can save you a lot of troubles.
